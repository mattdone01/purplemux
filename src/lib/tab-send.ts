 *
 * - `live-session` — "is there something on the other end?". A tab whose tmux
 *   session runs is delivered to, in every `cliState` including `busy`. This is
 *   what the web client has always done: `POST /api/tmux/send-input` reads no
 *   `cliState` at all, and an agent TUI queues a prompt that arrives mid-turn.
 *   Every client driven by a person typing belongs on this gate.
 *
 * - `composer-ready` — "is there an empty composer to paste into?". Holds until
 *   the agent reports a composer, and at the deadline refuses with nothing
 *   pasted. This is story 22's gate and it must stay: a brief dispatched by
 *   `purplemux tab send` the instant a tab is created races the TUI's boot, and
 *   a paste that wins that race has its trailing Enter swallowed — the text
 *   sits in the input box, the agent never takes a turn, and the caller is told
 *   `submitted: true`. It cost fifty minutes of an epic once.
 *
 * The distinction is boot-race versus mid-turn, not caution versus recklessness.
 * A person watching the screen sees a swallowed Enter and presses it; an
 * unattended orchestrator dispatching a brief does not, which is why only that
 * path waits.
