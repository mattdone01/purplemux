# Deploying purplemux on the live host

`scripts/deploy-live.sh` is the only deploy path. `orchestration/deploy.sh` is superseded. The decision record is [ADR-0017](adr/0017-deploys-through-releases-quiet-wait-and-rollback.md).

## Layout

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `~/.purplemux/releases/<sha12>/` | a detached worktree of `~/code/purplemux`, built |
| `~/.purplemux/releases/current` | symlink to the running release |
| `~/.purplemux/releases/previous` | symlink to the rollback target |
| `~/.purplemux/releases/first-install-rollback/` | the drop-in and CLI link target from before the first release install |
| `~/.purplemux/backups/<stamp>-<sha12>/` | `*.json` stores and `mission-control.sqlite`, newest 5 |
| `~/.purplemux/logs/deploy-live-<stamp>-<sha12>.log` | build output |
| `~/.config/systemd/user/purplemux.service.d/50-mission-control.conf` | runs `releases/current` after the first install |
| `~/.local/bin/purplemux` | symlink to `releases/current/bin/purplemux.js` |

## Run a deploy

The run takes longer than the 10-minute foreground limit of an agent's shell tool. Start it with the host's background mechanism (Claude Code: `run_in_background`) and read the summary when it exits.

```bash
~/code/purplemux/.worktrees/<worktree>/scripts/deploy-live.sh <git-ref>
```

Options:

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | build, run the acceptance gate and report the quiet state; no backup, no swap, no restart |
| `--quiet-timeout SECONDS` | bound of the quiet wait (default 900) |
| `--force-after-timeout` | deploy even if tabs are still mid-turn at the timeout |
| `--ignore-tab WS/TAB` | exclude one more tab from the quiet wait (repeatable) |
| `--outside-tab` | the shell runs outside every purplemux tab, so there is no own tab to exclude |
| `--rollback` | swap `current` and `previous`, restart, health-check |

The tab in `PMUX_TAB_ID` is always excluded from the quiet wait. A tab created before story 01 has no `PMUX_TAB_ID`; the script then refuses with `REFUSED OWN-TAB-UNKNOWN` until you name your own tab with `--ignore-tab <ws>/<tab>` (or pass `--outside-tab` from a plain shell).

## Exit codes

| Exit | Meaning | Live service |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | deployed, rolled back on demand, or dry run | new release (or unchanged on dry run) |
| 1 | lease probe or acquire failed, backup failed, tmux sessions unreadable | unchanged |
| 2 | refused: usage, ref, disk, build, own tab unknown, drop-in drift or rewrite, half-finished first install, rollback target missing or unbuilt | unchanged |
| 3 | quiet timeout, deploy lease held, another deploy running | unchanged |
| 4 | restart, `daemon-reload` or health gate failed; the previous release was restored (`VERDICT=rolled-back`); the automatic rollback failed too (`VERDICT=rollback-failed`, read `ROLLBACK_HEALTH=` and the journal); or an on-demand rollback failed its gate (`VERDICT=rollback-unhealthy`) | previous release, or check by hand on `rollback-failed` / `rollback-unhealthy` |

The last lines are one summary block: `RELEASE=`, `PREVIOUS=`, `SESSIONS=kept/before`, `HEALTH=`, `ROLLBACK_HEALTH=` (after a rollback), `QUIET=`, `LEASE=`, `BACKUP=`, `ACCEPTANCE=`, `INTERRUPTED=` (when a signal arrived in the swap window), `VERDICT=`.

## Acceptance gate

After the build and before the lease, the quiet wait, the backup or any switch, the script runs the
release's OWN `scripts/acceptance/run.sh --candidate <release>`. A failure, or a release without the
harness, refuses with exit 2 (`ACCEPTANCE-FAILED` / `ACCEPTANCE-MISSING`); the live service is
untouched. `--rollback` skips it: the target already ran live. `DEPLOY_BASH_GUARD=<bash-guard.py>`
adds the engineering guard check and makes it required. The log is
`~/.purplemux/logs/acceptance-<stamp>-<sha12>.log`.

The gate starts the release as a second server that shares nothing with the live one:
`HOME=/tmp/pmxa.XXXXXX/home` (so `~/.purplemux` is throwaway), `TMUX_TMPDIR=/tmp/pmxa.XXXXXX/tmux`
(its own `tmux -L purple` socket), `HOST=localhost` on a spare port >= 18000, and `env -i` with a
short whitelist, because a shell inside a live tab carries `PMUX_TOKEN`, `TMUX` and the live
`__PMUX_PRISTINE_ENV`, which the candidate would hand to its own tabs. It refuses before starting
when the scratch HOME or socket would resolve to the live ones, when the socket path exceeds the unix
limit, or when the port is the live one or answers. After the start it reads the candidate
processes' environ and refuses (`NOT-ISOLATED`) if any live key (`PMUX_TOKEN`, `PMUX_TAB_TOKEN`,
`TMUX`, …) or a pristine env with another HOME got through. The state file is written as soon as the
server starts, and any failure or signal after that tears the instance down. Teardown scans `/proc`
and stops every process whose environ carries the scratch HOME (by process group when the group
leader is one of them) and never signals any other process; tmux is killed only through the scratch
socket. The gate runs without deploy-live's lock descriptor, so a leftover could never hold the lock.

The checks (`scripts/acceptance/checks.cjs`) run the release's installed entry point `bin/purplemux.js`,
and each prints `PASS`/`FAIL` with what it measured and expected:

| Check | Proves |
|---|---|
| `tab-create`, `tab-list`, `tab-send-result`, `tab-status` | tab create/list/send/result/status in two workspaces |
| `identity-env` | a tab carries `PMUX_TAB_ID` and `PMUX_TAB_TOKEN` (ADR-0010) |
| `lease-race`, `lease-verified` | two tabs race one merge lease: one wins, one gets exit 3 naming the holder, the holder is verified |
| `lease-renew-release`, `lease-expiry` | renew and release by the holder only; a 2 s lease expires (ADR-0011) |
| `epic-ownership`, `num-claim` | an epic claim frees when its tab closes; a number claim survives its tab until `release-epic` |
| `exit-4-target-gone`, `exit-2-usage`, `exit-7-not-found`, `exit-6-unreachable`, `exit-6-routes-absent` | the CLI exit-code contract (ADR-0016) |
| `bash-guard` | with `--bash-guard`: the guard allows the holder's merge and refuses another tab's |
| `turn-marker`, `turn-waiting`, `turn-ready` | ADR-0018 with a scratch `claude` stand-in and posted hook events: a marker line reaches the orchestrator nudge; a stop with a live `tab bg` job stays busy with no nudge; a plain stop keeps READY FOR REVIEW |
| `live-socket-untouched` | no isolated session appeared on the live tmux socket |

Run it by hand against any built checkout:
`scripts/acceptance/run.sh --candidate <dir> [--log FILE] [--bash-guard PATH] [--keep]`.

## Health gate

Within 90 s after the restart, all of these must hold:

1. `systemctl --user restart` exited 0.
2. The service has a new `MainPID`, and `/proc/<pid>/cwd` resolves to the release directory. `/api/health` answers the same for every release, so this check is what proves the new code runs.
3. `GET /api/health` answers `app: purplemux`.
4. Every tmux session name recorded before the restart still exists. New sessions are allowed.
5. A workspace-token `purplemux tab list` answers. With no workspace token on the host the check is reported as skipped (`HEALTH=pass (tab-list skipped: no workspace token)`).

From the first link change until the gate or the rollback ends, the script defers INT and TERM. A `SIGKILL` in that window can still leave the links swapped; run `--rollback` or check `releases/current` by hand. A run that received a deferred signal still reports its verdict, but it skips the release rotation (`ROTATION=skipped …`).

## The first install

The first run finds no `releases/current`. It then:

1. links `releases/previous` to the directory the drop-in runs today (`.worktrees/mission-control-human-escalation` on 2026-09-26);
2. saves the drop-in and the `~/.local/bin/purplemux` target to `releases/first-install-rollback/`;
3. rewrites the drop-in to `releases/current` and prints the diff;
4. runs `systemctl --user daemon-reload` before the restart.

The first wave-1 deploy runs against the b428f4d1 server: `LEASE=unavailable (server predates leases)` is expected, and the quiet wait reads each agent tab's status route because that tab list has no `cliState`.

## Roll back

- Automatic: a failed health gate restores the links from before the run and exits 4. The summary and the journal lines show why.
- On demand: `scripts/deploy-live.sh --rollback` from `releases/current/scripts/`. Right after a first install it restores the saved drop-in and CLI link and removes `current` and `previous`. It continues past a broken lease route or lease CLI (`LEASE=unavailable (…; rollback proceeds)`); only a live `deploy:purplemux` holder elsewhere stops it.
- A rollback swaps code only and never restores a backup. Restore a backup by hand only with the service stopped.
- **bash-guard coupling.** Rolling back to a build without leases while the engineering bash-guard lease rules are live makes every merge fail closed. Set `MERGE_LEASE_OK=1` for the orchestrator (fleet-wide if needed) or revert the engineering change until a lease-capable release runs again.

## Old releases

Each successful deploy keeps `current` and `previous` and removes other release worktrees under `releases/` by exact path (`git worktree remove`). A directory under `releases/` that is not a worktree of the primary repository is reported as `PRUNE-SKIPPED` and left alone. The live worktree that `previous` names after a first install is outside `releases/` and is never removed.

## Testing

`tests/unit/scripts/deploy-live.test.ts` runs the script against fake `systemctl`, `pnpm`, `curl`, `tmux`, `purplemux` and `journalctl` binaries (`DEPLOY_*` overrides), a temporary `HOME` and a real git repository. It never reaches the live service.
