# `~/.purplemux/` Settings Directory

All persistent state (settings, layouts, session history, caches) lives under `~/.purplemux/`. See [CLAUDE.md §15](../CLAUDE.md) — memory/variables and `localStorage` are not used.

File permissions are `0600` for anything containing a secret (config, tokens, layouts, VAPID keys, lock file). Writes go through a `tmpFile → rename` pattern plus a `withLock` promise queue (in-process) to avoid interleaved writes.

## Top-level Files

### `config.json` — `src/lib/config-store.ts`

App-wide settings. `authPassword` is scrypt-hashed (`scrypt:{salt}:{hash}`); deleting the file resets onboarding.

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `authPassword` | scrypt hash of the login password |
| `authSecret` | HMAC secret for session tokens (32 bytes hex) |
| `appTheme` | `light` / `dark` |
| `terminalTheme` | `{ light, dark }` xterm.js theme names |
| `customCSS` | User-injected CSS string |
| `locale` | `en` / `ko` / `ja` / … |
| `fontSize` | `small` / `normal` / `large` |
| `notificationsEnabled` | System/web-push notification toggle |
| `dangerouslySkipPermissions` | Pass `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to Claude |
| `editorUrl` / `editorPreset` | External editor (e.g. code-server, VS Code) |
| `networkAccess` | `localhost` / `network` — server bind scope |
| `systemResourcesEnabled` | CPU/memory stats display toggle |
| `updatedAt` | ISO timestamp |

Electron additionally stores `server` (`local`/`remote` mode + `remoteUrl`) and `windowState` (position, size, fullscreen) in this file — see `electron/main.ts`.

### `workspaces.json` — `src/lib/workspace-store.ts`

Workspace index and sidebar state. Per-workspace tab/pane tree lives under `workspaces/{wsId}/layout.json`.

```jsonc
{
  "workspaces": [
    { "id": "ws-MMKl07", "name": "purplemux", "directories": ["/path"], "order": 0 }
  ],
  "activeWorkspaceId": "ws-MMKl07",
  "sidebarCollapsed": false,
  "sidebarWidth": 285,
  "updatedAt": "2026-04-18T15:31:48.741Z"
}
```

Legacy migrations: `tabs.json` → `layout.json` → `workspaces/{wsId}/layout.json`. Parse failures copy the file to `.json.bak` and start fresh.

### `hooks.json` — `src/lib/hook-settings.ts`

Claude Code `--settings` file. Regenerated on server startup from `buildHookSettings()`; overwrites are skipped when content matches.

Hooks mapped to `status-hook.sh`:

| Event | Arg |
| --- | --- |
| `SessionStart` | `session-start` |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `prompt-submit` |
| `Notification` | `notification` |
| `Stop` / `StopFailure` | `stop` |
| `PreCompact` | `pre-compact` |
| `PostCompact` | `post-compact` |

Plus `statusLine.command = sh "~/.purplemux/statusline.sh"`.

See [STATUS.md](./STATUS.md) for the full status-detection flow.

### `status-hook.sh`, `codex-hook.sh`, `grok-hook.sh`, `statusline.sh`

Auto-generated from `HOOK_SCRIPT_CONTENT`, `CODEX_HOOK_SCRIPT_CONTENT` and `GROK_HOOK_SCRIPT_CONTENT` (`hook-settings.ts`) and `STATUSLINE_SCRIPT_CONTENT` (`statusline-script.ts`). All of them:

1. Read `port` and `cli-token` from `~/.purplemux/`
2. `POST` to the local server with `x-pmux-token` header
3. Fail silently if the server is down

`grok-hook.sh` reads Grok Build's payload from **stdin** (grok pipes the event JSON to the hook process; the keys are camelCase and the `hookEventName` VALUE is snake_case), forwards it verbatim, and also passes `GROK_HOOK_EVENT` — which grok injects into every hook process — as a query parameter so an empty stdin still reports. It time-boxes the request with `curl --max-time 2`, backgrounds it, and always exits 0: `Stop` runs on the turn's critical path and a non-zero exit there would block grok from finishing.

Do not edit these by hand — they are rewritten on startup when content differs.

### `workspaces/{wsId}/grok-home/` and `$GROK_HOME/hooks/purplemux.json`

Grok Build reads `GROK_HOME` instead of `~/.grok` when it is set, so each workspace pane launches
with its own store (`src/lib/grok-home.ts`, ADR-0005). Inside a workspace grok home:

- **private, real directories:** `sessions/`, `hooks/`, `logs/` — this is the isolation.
- **symlinks back to `~/.grok`:** `auth.json`, `config.toml`, `managed_config.toml`,
  `requirements.toml`, `pager.toml`, `lsp.json`, `trusted_folders.toml`, `mcp_credentials.json`,
  `skills/`, `commands/`, `rules/`, `memory/`, `agents/`, `plugins/`, `workflows/`. Credentials and
  configuration stay common, so a workspace tab never asks the user to sign in again. An entry the
  install does not have is skipped.

Ad-hoc tabs (no workspace) run against the real `~/.grok`.

purplemux owns exactly one file in each grok home: `hooks/purplemux.json`, written at mode 0600 in
the Claude Code hooks JSON format. Grok merges every `*.json` in that directory, so a hook the user
wrote alongside it is never touched. The file is rewritten when its content changes — on server boot
for every existing home, and again at pane launch for a workspace created after boot.

Registered events: `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `StopFailure`, `StopCancelled`,
`Notification` (matcher `permission_prompt|idle_prompt|task_complete`), `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`,
`SessionEnd`, `PostToolUse` (matcher `Edit|Write|MultiEdit|Bash|search_replace|run_terminal_command`
— grok's matcher is a regular expression and keeps the Claude tool names it aliases, so both
spellings fire).

purplemux never writes `~/.grok/config.toml`.

grok's transcripts are JSONL: `$GROK_HOME/sessions/<url-encoded cwd>/<session-id>/updates.jsonl`,
the authoritative ACP session-update stream. purplemux reads it and never writes to a grok store.

### `rate-limits.json`

Claude CLI writes its statusline JSON via stdin → `statusline.sh` → `POST /api/status/statusline` → server persists here. Watched by `rate-limits-watcher.ts` (debounced 500 ms); updates drive the rate-limit UI. Schema: `ts`, `model`, `five_hour`, `seven_day`, `context`, `cost`.

### `session-history.json` — `src/lib/session-history.ts`

Cross-workspace log of completed Claude sessions (max 200 entries, version 1). Keyed by `IHistoryEntry` (prompt, result, duration, tool usage, touched files).

### `quick-prompts.json`, `sidebar-items.json` — `src/lib/{quick-prompts,sidebar-items}-store.ts`

User customizations layered on top of built-in lists. Structure:

```json
{ "custom": [...], "disabledBuiltinIds": [...], "order": [...] }
```

Built-ins (`BUILTIN_PROMPTS`, `BUILTIN_ITEMS`) are defined in code; the disk file only records overrides and ordering.

### `vapid-keys.json`, `push-subscriptions.json`

Web Push state. VAPID keypair is generated on first run (`vapid-keys.ts`) and cached in memory. Subscriptions are managed per-browser via `push-subscriptions.ts`.

`push-subscriptions.json` is an array of records:

```json
[
  {
    "subscription": { "endpoint": "https://…", "keys": { "p256dh": "…", "auth": "…" } },
    "deviceId": "kQ9…",
    "label": "Pixel",
    "createdAt": 1755300000000
  }
]
```

`deviceId` is the browser's `purplemux-device-id` (localStorage, sent by `use-web-push.ts` with the subscription). It is what makes the push visibility gate per-device — a focused desktop no longer mutes the phone. Rows written before this wrapper existed are bare `PushSubscription` objects; `normalizeSubscriptionRecords` wraps them on read with `createdAt: 0` and no `deviceId`, and an unbound row keeps the old "any focused window mutes push" gate until that browser re-subscribes.

### `cli-token`, `port`

Shared handshake between the server and any CLI/hook that needs to reach it:

- `cli-token` — 32-byte hex token (`randomBytes(32)`), compared with `timingSafeEqual` in `cli-token.ts`. Read by `bin/cli.js` and all hook scripts via the `x-pmux-token` header.
- `port` — plain-text current port, written by `ensureHookSettings(port)` at startup.

### `pmux.lock` — `src/lib/lock.ts`

Single-instance guard. Contains `{pid, port, startedAt}`. On startup:

1. Attempt `open(LOCK_FILE, 'wx')` — if successful, we own it.
2. If it exists, read the PID. Dead PID → reclaim. Alive but `GET /api/health` does not reply `{ app: 'purplemux' }` → reclaim.
3. Alive + healthy → abort with "already running".

Released on `process.on('exit')`.

---

## Per-workspace Directory (`workspaces/{wsId}/`)

### `layout.json` — `src/lib/layout-store.ts`

Recursive pane/tab tree. Leaf `pane` nodes hold `tabs[]`; `split` nodes hold `children[]` with `ratio`. Each tab carries its `sessionName` (`pt-{wsId}-{paneId}-{tabId}`), cached `cliState`, `claudeSessionId`, and the last resume command.

See [TMUX.md](./TMUX.md) for how tabs map to tmux sessions and [STATUS.md](./STATUS.md) for the state fields.

### `message-history.json` — `src/lib/message-history-store.ts`

Per-workspace input history for Claude tabs. Capped at 500 entries. Locks are keyed by `wsId` so parallel workspace writes do not block each other.

### `claude-prompt.md` — `src/lib/claude-prompt.ts`

The `--append-system-prompt-file` content passed to every Claude tab in the workspace. Regenerated whenever the workspace is created, renamed, or its directories change. Contains workspace ID + CLI quick-reference.

### `standups.json` — `src/lib/standup-store.ts`

Orchestrator standup ticks, newest first, capped at 50. The latest tick renders in the
workspace sidebar; `StatusManager` hydrates from this file on boot so "where are things
at" survives a server restart. See STATUS.md → Standup Ticks for the full flow.

### `claude-home/` — `src/lib/workspace-home.ts`

The workspace's private `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, set on every pane at launch (`src/lib/tmux.ts`). `projects/` and `sessions/` are real per-workspace directories — this is what keeps conversation history and resume lists separate for workspaces sharing one project root — while credentials, settings, commands, hooks, rules and plugins are symlinks back into `~/.claude`, recreated on each launch. Session detection, session lists, and timeline jsonl resolution all resolve against this directory for workspace panes (`~/.claude` remains the home for non-workspace sessions).

---

## `logs/`

Pino-roll output. One file per UTC day with numeric suffix when size is exceeded:

```
purplemux.2026-04-19.1.log
```

Root level defaults to `info`; override with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` or per-group with `LOG_LEVELS=hooks=debug,status=warn,tmux=trace`. See `src/lib/logger.ts`.

---

## `uploads/` — `src/lib/uploads-store.ts`

Images attached via the chat input bar (drag/drop, paste, paperclip). Saved as `{timestamp}-{rand}-{name}.{ext}` under `{wsId}/{tabId}/` so paths can be passed to the running Claude CLI.

- Allowed MIME types: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`
- Max size: 10 MB
- Files are written with `0600` permissions
- Auto-cleanup on server start removes anything older than 24 hours
- Manual cleanup: Settings → System → Attached Images → Clean now (or `POST /api/uploads/cleanup` with `{ "mode": "all" | "expired" }`)

---

## `stats/`

Claude usage statistics cache. Derived from `{home}/projects/**/*.jsonl` across every claude home (`~/.claude` plus each workspace `claude-home/`) — purplemux only reads those directories. Each transcript lives in exactly one home, so the union cannot double-count.

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `cache.json` | `IStatsFileCache` — per-day aggregates (messages, sessions, tool calls, hourly counts, per-model token usage). Cache version `1`. |
| `uptime-cache.json` | Per-day uptime/active-minutes roll-up. |
| `daily-reports/{date}.json` | AI-generated daily brief (`IDailyReportDay`) keyed by `YYYY-MM-DD`. |

All files here are regeneratable — deleting them just triggers a recompute on the next stats request.

---

## Deleting to Reset

| To reset… | Delete |
| --- | --- |
| Login password (onboarding again) | `config.json` |
| All workspaces and tabs | `workspaces.json` + `workspaces/` |
| A single workspace's layout | `workspaces/{wsId}/layout.json` (it will be recreated as a default pane) |
| Usage statistics | `stats/` |
| Push subscriptions | `push-subscriptions.json` |
| Stuck "already running" | `pmux.lock` (only if no purplemux process is alive) |

`hooks.json`, `status-hook.sh`, `codex-hook.sh`, `grok-hook.sh`, `statusline.sh`, `port`, `cli-token`, `vapid-keys.json` are auto-regenerated on the next startup.

Deleting `$GROK_HOME/hooks/purplemux.json` is safe — it is regenerated on the next startup, and it is
the only file in that directory purplemux owns. Deleting a workspace `grok-home/` discards that
workspace's grok session history; the shared credentials and configuration it links to are untouched.
